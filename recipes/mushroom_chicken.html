        <p>Ingredients</p>
        For the Chicken
        <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (or thighs)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil or butter</li>
        <p>For the Mushroom Sauce</p>
        <li>2 cups mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>¾ cup cooking cream (or heavy cream)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme or mixed herbs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon flour (optional, for thickening)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Season the Chicken</li>
        <p>Season chicken with salt, pepper, and paprika on both sides.</p>
        <li>Sear the Chicken</li>
        <p>
          Heat oil or butter in a large pan over medium heat. Cook the chicken
          for 5–6 minutes per side until golden brown. Remove from the pan and
          set aside.
        </p>
        <li>Cook the Mushrooms</li>
        <p>
          In the same pan, add butter and sauté mushrooms until they release
          moisture and become lightly browned.
        </p>
        <li>Add Aromatics</li>
        <p>
          Add chopped onion and cook until soft. Stir in garlic and cook for
          about 1 minute until fragrant.
        </p>
        <li>Prepare the Sauce</li>
        <p>
          Sprinkle flour (if using) and stir well. Gradually add chicken stock
          while stirring to avoid lumps. Allow the sauce to simmer for 2–3
          minutes.
        </p>
        <li>Add Cream and Herbs</li>
        <p>
          Pour in the cream and add thyme or mixed herbs. Stir and let the sauce
          gently simmer until slightly thickened.
        </p>
        <li>Return the Chicken</li>
        <p>
          Place the chicken back into the pan, spoon sauce over it, and simmer
          for 8–10 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked and tender.
        </p>
        <li>Garnish and Serve</li>
        <p>
          Sprinkle fresh parsley on top and serve warm with rice, pasta, or
          vegetables.

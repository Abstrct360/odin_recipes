      <h2>Recipe description</h2>
      <p>
        Greek honey cake is a traditional Mediterranean dessert known for its
        soft, moist texture and rich aromatic flavor. Sweetened naturally with
        honey and often infused with citrus, cinnamon, or warm spices, this cake
        reflects the simplicity of Greek home baking. After baking, the cake is
        typically soaked in a fragrant honey syrup, giving it a delicate
        sweetness and a tender crumb. It is commonly served with chopped nuts
        such as walnuts or almonds and enjoyed with coffee or tea.

      <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <p></p>
          <p>Reheat oven to 180°C (350°F).Grease and lightly flour a baking pan.</p>
          <li>Mix Dry Ingredients</li>
          <p>In a bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.</p>
          <li>Prepare Wet Mixture</li>
          <p>In a separate bowl, beat eggs and sugar until light and slightly fluffy. 
            Add olive oil (or butter), yogurt, milk, vanilla, and citrus zest.Mix well.</p>
          <li>Combine Mixtures</li> 
          <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring
          gently until a smooth batter forms. Avoid overmixing.</p>
          <li>Bake the Cake</li>
          <p>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 30–40 minutes, or
          until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</p>
          <li>Prepare the Honey Syrup</li>
          <p>While the cake bakes, combine honey, water, sugar,
          cinnamon stick, and citrus peel in a saucepan. Simmer for 5–7
          minutes until slightly thickened. Remove from heat and allow to cool

          <p>Sprinkle chopped nuts on top and drizzle with extra honey if desired. Allow the cake to rest for at
          least 20 minutes before serving.</p>

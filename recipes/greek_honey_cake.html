      <h2>Recipe description</h2>
      <p>
        Greek honey cake is a traditional Mediterranean dessert known for its
        soft, moist texture and rich aromatic flavor. Sweetened naturally with
        honey and often infused with citrus, cinnamon, or warm spices, this cake
        reflects the simplicity of Greek home baking. After baking, the cake is
        typically soaked in a fragrant honey syrup, giving it a delicate
        sweetness and a tender crumb. It is commonly served with chopped nuts
        such as walnuts or almonds and enjoyed with coffee or tea.

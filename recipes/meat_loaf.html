      <h2>Recipe description</h2>
      <p>
        Meatloaf is a comforting, traditional dish made from seasoned ground
        meat shaped into a loaf and baked until tender and flavorful. Popular in
        many households, it combines minced meat with breadcrumbs, herbs, and
        spices to create a moist, hearty meal. Topped with a savory tomato-based
        glaze, meatloaf offers a balance of rich flavor and soft texture. It is
        commonly served with mashed potatoes, vegetables, or salad, making it a
        satisfying family-style main course.

      <h2>Recipe description</h2>
      <p>
        Meatloaf is a comforting, traditional dish made from seasoned ground
        meat shaped into a loaf and baked until tender and flavorful. Popular in
        many households, it combines minced meat with breadcrumbs, herbs, and
        spices to create a moist, hearty meal. Topped with a savory tomato-based
        glaze, meatloaf offers a balance of rich flavor and soft texture. It is
        commonly served with mashed potatoes, vegetables, or salad, making it a
        satisfying family-style main course.

        <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley or mixed herbs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cooking oil (for sautéing)</li>
        <p>For the Glaze:</p>
        <li>⅓ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mustard (optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the Oven</li>
        <p>Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F). Lightly grease a baking tray or loaf pan.</p>
        <li>Prepare the Aromatics</li>
        <p>Heat oil in a pan and sauté the chopped onion for 3–4 minutes until soft. 
        Add garlic and cook for another minute. Allow to cool slightly.</p>
        <li>Combine Ingredients</li>
        <p>In a large bowl, mix ground meat, breadcrumbs, egg, milk, sautéed onion and garlic,
        ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and herbs.</p>
        <li>Shape the Loaf</li>
        <p>Transfer the mixture to the baking tray or loaf pan and shape it into a
        compact loaf.</p>
         <li>Prepare the Glaze</li>
        <p>In a small bowl, mix ketchup, brown sugar, and mustard. Spread half of the 
        glaze evenly over the top of the meatloaf.</p>
        <li>Bake</li>
        <p>Bake for 45–55 minutes, or until fully cooked and the
        internal temperature reaches about 70–75°C (160–165°F).</p>
        <li>Add Final Glaze</li>
        <p>Remove from the oven, spread the remaining glaze on top, and return to
        the oven for an additional 5–10 minutes.</p>
        <li>Rest and Serve</li>
        <p>Allow the meatloaf to rest for 10 minutes before slicing to help retain its juices.</p>
      </ol>

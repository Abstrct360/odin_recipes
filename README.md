Project Overview: Basic Recipe Gallery

The Basic Recipe Gallery is an introductory web development project designed to build foundational skills in HTML5. The objective is to create a clean, well-structured, and fully functional recipe website while gaining practical experience with semantic HTML elements and proper document organization.
This project emphasizes clarity, accessibility, and logical content structure—key principles in professional web development.

Core Learning Objectives

1. Document Structure
    •	Correct implementation of essential HTML5 elements: <html>, <head>, and <body> 

2. Text Hierarchy and Semantic Structure
    •	Using <h1> for the main site title: “Odin Recipes” and apply <h2> and <h3> for section headings such as Ingredients and Preparation Instructions so as to improve to the readability and accessibility of the content.

3. Multimedia Integration
    •	Embedding images using the <img> tag and setting up appropriate dimensions, including descriptive alt attributes for accessibility. The image will present high-quality food photography to enhance visual appeal.

4. List Structures
    •	Unordered Lists (<ul>): Used to clearly organize ingredients for quick scanning.
    •	Ordered Lists (<ol>): Used to present step-by-step preparation instructions in logical chronological order.

5. Navigation and Linking
    The project will utilise the anchor tags (<a>) to connect individual recipe pages and link all recipe pages to the main index.html file. The link will be used to provide navigation back to the homepage from each recipe page thereby creating a simple but functional multi-page website structure.

Page Features

The completed website will showcase five distinct recipes, each including:
    •	Compelling Header: The name of the dish presented as the primary heading.
    •	Summary Paragraph: A brief description highlighting the dish’s flavor profile, origin, or cultural significance.
    •	Visual Representation: A high-quality image of the finished dish (e.g., a classic sponge cake), properly sized and formatted.
    •	Ingredient Checklist: A clearly structured bulleted list allowing users to quickly review required ingredients.
    •	Preparation Guide: A numbered, step-by-step instruction list to ensure accurate and sequential preparation.

Expected Outcome

After completing this project, I want to achieve the following:
    •	Understand fundamental HTML page structure
    •	Apply semantic elements effectively
    •	Build a multi-page website with internal navigation
    •	Develop confidence in organizing and presenting structured content
